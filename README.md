# ewaff

Efficient and flexible algorithms for EWAS

## Things to do

- multi-core optional for windows or other debilitated users
- use tableone for output (per model)
- EWAS comparison function
- EWAS meta-analysis
- expand EWAS report for multi-variable ewas
- support adjustment for case-control
- flexible batch control
- correlation threshold for association between variable of interest and SVAs
- **a function called ewaff.pace() that runs the PACE workflow**
- Can we have "table one" as an object in the output? and/or can this
    be easily written to a standard dataframe/csv file?
- Another way to potentially speed up SVA: https://cran.r-project.org/package=irlba
